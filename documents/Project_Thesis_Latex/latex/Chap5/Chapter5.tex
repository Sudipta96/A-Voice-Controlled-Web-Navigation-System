\section{Major Findings of the Work}
The Voice Search Chrome Extension project shows a successful implementation of a voice-controlled browser interface, enabling users to communicate with browser in English and Bangla and perform various tasks. The major findings of the work are summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] 	\textbf{Functional Achievement:} The proposed system successfully implemented core features: voice-based search, click highlighted links, read selected text, form filling and media control.
\item[2.]	\textbf{Multilingual Support:} Supports both English and Bangla commands, display the current language, properly identify the language and perform actions.
\item[3.]	\textbf{Real-time Performance:} Showed real time performance due to the installation on the client Chrome browser and provided smooth and real time user interaction.
\item[4.]	\textbf{Accuracy:} Achieved almost ~90 percent accuracy for English commands and ~75-80 percent accuracy for Bengali commands indicating reliable accessibility.
\item[5.]	\textbf{User-Friendly Interface:} The floating mic button provided easy access to the user to interact with the system, visual feedback improves user experience.
\item[6.]	\textbf{Modular Architecture:} The system is modular and scalable.  New commands can be easily added to the further enhancement.
\item[7.]	\textbf{Performance:} Although speech recognition module sometimes took time to take accurate input but command parsing is very fast. Overall performance is acceptable in real world.
\item[8.]	\textbf{Testing and Validation:} Functional, performance, language and cross-page testing demonstrated that the system is robust, reliable, fast and user-friendly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
Although the current system achieved the primary objectives, there are several places to improve and enhance this system in future:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]	\textbf{Expand Language Support:} To add more languages apart from English and Bangla make the system widely acceptable to the wider region.
\item[2.]	\textbf{Advanced NLP:} To integrate NLP techniques to understand complex commands improving flexibility and accuracy.
\item[3.]	\textbf{Customized Commands:} This is an important feature which allow to add commands from user to make this system more user-friendly to the user and reliable. It will allow users to add custom voice commands and map them to specific actions in the browser.
\item[4.]	\textbf{Improve Accuracy:} Accuracy is one of the major problems in the speech recognition modules. So by adding noise reduction and filtering techniques, the accuracy of the speech recognition can be improved in future. 
\item[5.]	\textbf{Performance Optimization:} Reduce the latency between voice and execute action will improve the response time.
\item[6.]	\textbf{UI Enhancement:} Provide more attractive visual feedback, such as color scheme, tool tips and animations will make this system more attractive to the users.
\item[7.]	\textbf{Integration Other Features:} Summarize the content of the current page,extend support to the email, google maps, google docs or social media platforms make this system more valuable to the users.
\item[8.]    \textbf{Analytics and Usage Statistics:} Add a module to track the command uses, success rate/failure rate of the command execution help developers to optimize performance.
\item[9]	\textbf{Security and Privacy:} Enhance security by processing voice data locally will ensure user privacy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The voice search chrome extension demonstrates the implementation of a successful voice controlled browser extension with dual language support and provides real-time performance, scalability and user-friendliness. The modular design and tests confirms that the proposed system is fast, reliable, secure and easy to use. The future work outlined above provides a roadmap for enhancing performance, reliability, scalability and making the system more accessible and more intelligent.
